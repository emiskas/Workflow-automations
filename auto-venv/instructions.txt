Auto Virtualenv Activation (Project Root Only)
----------------------------------------------

Description:
This script overrides the default `cd` command in Bash to automatically
create and/or activate a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) when
entering the root directory of a Django project (identified by `manage.py`).

Features:
- Detects if you're at the root of a Django project.
- Creates a `.venv` if none exists.
- Automatically activates `.venv` if it exists.
- Silent in all other directories (no unnecessary activations).

Instructions:
1. Copy the script into the VPS userâ€™s home directory, e.g. ~/auto_venv.sh

2. Open (or create) the Bash configuration file:
   nano ~/.bashrc

3. Source the script by adding this line at the end of ~/.bashrc:
   source ~/auto_venv.sh

4. Reload the Bash configuration to apply changes immediately:
   source ~/.bashrc

Usage:
- Simply `cd` into a Django project root (directory containing `manage.py`).
- `.venv` will be created if missing, and automatically activated.
- Subsequent logins or `cd` actions will re-activate it automatically.
