# Django Watcher Setup (with Gunicorn Restart)

## Description
This automation watches a Django project directory for changes to Python files.
When a file is saved, it automatically restarts the Gunicorn service.
The watcher is installed as a systemd service so it runs in the background, persists through logouts, and survives server reboots.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y inotify-tools

2. Give user sudo permission to restart Gunicorn:
   sudo visudo
   # Add this line at the end:
   youruser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart gunicorn

3. Create the systemd service:
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/watcher.service

   # Paste this:
   [Unit]
   Description=Inotify Watcher for Django Projects
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=youruser
   ExecStart=/home/youruser/watcher.sh
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target

4. Enable and start the service:
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable watcher.service
   sudo systemctl start watcher.service

5. View logs:
   journalctl -u watcher.service -f
